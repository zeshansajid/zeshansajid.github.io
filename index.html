                            <p>In 2015 I attended the Edenred annual Hackathon, in which 200 international managers flew to Crete Greece to design and create a new pre-paid corporate service.
</p>

                            <p>During the event, my role was a freelance Visual/UX Designer in which I had to work with 15 international Edenred managers to create wireframes and mock-ups, based on group discussions, to ensure their idea was plausible in terms of UX and design.
</p>

                            <p>In addition, my role was to create visual design of proposed ideas and UX design which incorporated photorealistic mockups, to help market the product in the final presentation in front of 200 Edenred international managers.
</p>

                            <p>After the event, walkthroughs were created showcasing the features of the Money Touch application in the perspective of Parent – iPhone App, Child – iPhone and Apple Watch App.
</p>


						<p>Money Touch is an application, which allows parents to manage children’s spending habits by a rewards program via an iOS application. The parent initially setups the child account(s) and can set rewards for which the child can attempt to achieve. The child can access their account by logging into the iOS application using the credentials generated once parent has setup the account. The child can view the application using iPhone or Apple Watch.
</p>

						
						<p>
The application MoneyTouch also encourages children to save money, by showcasing cheaper products and services within their location using built in location services. 
</p>


						<p>
The app demos highlight the parent iOS application interface via iPhone, the child iOS application interface via iPhone and Apple Watch. The last app demo showcases the different features of the application within a promotional video.

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/aa.png" alt="">

                            <p>Agus Adventure is an endless 2D runner mobile video game created using the Unity game engine for iOS, Android, Blackberry 10, Windows Phone, and Amazon App Store. The game was created to understand how to learn the Unity game engine and familiarise with publishing mobile video games on multiple platforms. Agus Adventure adopts a one touch game mechanism allow people from all ages to easily pick up the game and play, making the game a more marketable product. </p>

                            <p>Previously the idea was to create a fully-fledged 3D mobile game for mobile devices. However after carrying research and analysis of the most popular mobile games across all mobile platforms key similarities were derived, which were used to enhance the chances of my first game being successful. The research highlighted than an mobile game must be simple to play, no use of on screen virtual D-pad and employ the use of cute cartoon characters such as Angry Birds/Flappy Bird to appeal to a wider audience. The following factors led to the game appealing to a much broader audience due to the simplicity and visuals of the game. The graphics were created using Adobe Photoshop CS6 and Adobe Illustrator CS6.</p>

                            <p>The game was released in July 2014 and has been featured on numerous websites and TV channels including Crackberry, AppsDoAndroid and the Peruvian TV channel Tec.TV. In order for Agus Adventure to be featured, promotional assets were created which consisted of daily posters, game trailers and slogans such as “How Far Can You Aguuuu?”</p>

                            <h2>Agu Splash</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">How Far Can You Aguuuu?</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/as.png" alt="">

                             <p>Agu Splash is the sequel to the 2D endless runner mobile game Agus Adventure. The game was published to a fewer number of platforms, due to the focus on social functionality for the game. The user would interact with the game by tilting the Agu alien left and right to climb on top of platforms and gain power-ups by eating cookies. Once the user finished their gameplay session, the user can share their gameplay footage alongside with their commentary using the in built microphone via Kamcord. The ability to share game footage allowed for greater marketing for the game, as the competition factor engaged most people to play the game and beat the score of their friends or family. </p>

                            <p>Agu Splash was released in November 2014, alongside with similar marketing material from the previous game, this included a game trailer, and daily updates on Twitter using the slogan “How Far Can You Aguuuu” and uploads from users around the world. </p>

                            <p>In addition, the game was designed to be played in portrait mode, as this prevents the user from tilting their phone, creating a larger footprint and making it less likely to be played one handed, reducing the number of casual users. </p>

                             <p>Mr Scoop is an iOS exclusive available on to the App Store. Mr Scoop has been designed from the ground up to appeal to all iOS devices users by integrating social and competitive elements. The aim of the game is to play one-handed and capture all the cookies within 60 seconds.  Due to the fact that the a game session only lasts 60s and can be played with one hand the game will be adopted by casual gamers who are performing their daily activities such as taking public transport or waiting for someone.</p>

                            <p>The game increases in difficulty in the last ten seconds by increasing the amount of cookies falling down. Once the user has finished the game, their score can be shared on Facebook and Twitter highlighting their “Scoop Score” with the hashtag #mrscoop. The use of sharing score via social media, will allow the game to be more marketable as the game would act as a common interest with friends and family. </p>

                            <p>Mr Scoop is now available on the App Store. However, marketing material was utilized to create a buzz for the game prior to release. The marketing material includes mock-ups of the game with the catchphrase “How Much Can You Scoop In 60s? Mr Scoop Coming Soon To The @AppStore #mrscoop”. In additional promotional videos have been created lasting 15 seconds, to maintain the attention of the target audience as well as the ability to be shared on platforms such as Twitter and Vine due to only lasting 15 seconds.</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/safe.png" alt="">

                            <p><p>LearnUrdu is a Built for Blackberry e-learning application created for the Blackberry 10 platform, which teaches users how to speak Urdu. The application aims to teach users Urdu by a combination of interactive exercises along with voice snippets, video tutorials and pictures to aid users in learning Urdu. The application was pitched in front of 200 developers and when completed gained 2nd Position with a reward of $2000 Canadian dollars.</p>

                            <p></p>

                             <p>LearnUrdu was created during the Blackberry Summer Camp Jam held in Madrid. The main focus of the event was to help developers create Built for Blackberry purposeful apps that would entice users to buy a Blackberry 10 handset over other rivals. </p>

                            <p>Initially the app idea was to create a video game using HTML5 WebWorks and the Construct 2 game engine to create a mobile video game. However, this had two major drawbacks, one was that the game would not be compatible across all mobile devices such as the Blackberry Q10 due to the aspect ratio. The second problem was that the mobile video game would not perform as efficiently as native application and would not incorporate the additional requirements that a Built for Blackberry application has, which was only awarded to application which signifies to customers the Blackberry 10 application delivers a signature Blackberry 10 experience. </p>


                            <p>When first arriving to Madrid, It was difficult to make conversation and communicate to the other 200 developers, which 90% were Spanish and English was not their first native language. This gave me the idea of making an e-learning language application, which taught users within UK how to speak Urdu due to the demand, as there are over 100 million people using Urdu as a first language with 40 million being purely within the UK. The application was also suited for the Blackberry 10 demographic due to their main target being enterprise and would suit businessmen and women who travel abroad frequently and find it difficult to interpret and understand language within certain part of Asia and Europe. </p>

                            <p>The software design of the application was based around the Built for Blackberry criteria, which focused on providing a seamless experience using the Blackberry 10 framework. Below are the design choices implemented within the application due to the criteria listed beside:</p>

                            <p>The application was ported to the Tizen platform, as part of the Tizen DevLab London. The application included the same core functionality as the Blackberry 10 version such as interactive exercises, video tutorials and pictures, however was created using HTML5 and Tizen SDK to provide a Tizen user experience. </p>

                           <p>Within my final year of BSc (Hons) Computer Science, a final year project was conducted, which proposed the following academic question: “To what extent will the development of e-learning formally replace attendance at educational institutions”. In order, to answer this question a prototype online e-learning application that teaches students basic Java programming skills was created. This was due to testing of the application, which explores the feasibility that an e-learning application can ultimately enhance or replace traditional learning.  Below is the presentation from my viva demonstration: </p>

                            <p>In Summer 2013 I was interviewed for the role of a Social Media Ambassador at Microsoft. The interview consisted of questions enquiring my previous social media management experience and how I thought products and services should be voiced over social media. Fortunately, I was chosen as a Social Media Ambassador, alongside 19 other people across the UK.</p>

                            <p>As a Windows Social Media Ambassador, we worked closely with WindowsAAA to create an awareness of Windows 8 and Windows Phone using social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Awareness of the Windows brand was created by spreading hashtags composed by the Microsoft PR Team such as #Windows8 and #W8Student. Original content was also created for the WindowsAAA Facebook page, highlighting the key features of Microsoft Word 2013 and the Windows 8 operating system to amplify awareness with the student community.</p>

                            <p>Alongside social media duties, my role also consisted of delivering hands on experience of Windows latest products, devices and services such as One Drive, Windows 8 and Windows Phone Live at Gadget Show Live Earls Court 2013.</p>

                            <p>At the end of the eight-month period, I was the top Windows Social Media Ambassador of 2013/14. My social media interactions resulted in 24241 Impressions, which were higher than other Windows Social Media Ambassador by at least 550%. Furthermore, my impressions generated by myself were higher than all the Windows Social Media Ambassador of 2012/13.</p>

                            <p>In Summer 2012 I was given the task to brand an upcoming Indian takeaway located in Acocks Green.  After listening to the manager’s ideas and thoughts, it was clear that the manager wanted to create an image which portrayed the food as good quality food, yet seem different from other rivals Indian takeaways.</p>

                            <p>The name Simply Spicy was chosen, as it provided the business a modern look, which would appeal to many ethnicities, not just people of southern Asian background.  The use of bright fresh colours such as red and greens were used, to define a certain style and highlight the ingredients used in Indian food. </p>

                            <p>The design and branding can be pictured in the logo, leaflet and posters with the use of simple plain Helvetica font and two-tone red and green colours. </p>

                            <p></p>

                            <p>
In June 2015, I attended the NBC Hackathon held in Impact Hub Westminster London as an Idea Generator. The Hackathon’s theme was The Future of Content Creation, Distribution, and Monetisation in a Connected World. 
</p>

                            <p>The day started off by Idea pitches, in which Idea Generators pitched in front of developers, designers, makers and marketers. After pitching, teams were formed consisting of 2-8 people.</p>

                            <p>My app idea was called Moment, based on the notion of ‘Live In The Moment’. The application monetized new and legacy content of NBC Universal via location services. </p>

                            <p>The best way to describe the application is through a scenario. For instance, you are walking through central London near were Fast 6 is set.  You are notified on your smartphone or wearable about a challenge, related to the movie. On completion of the challenge you can receive access to exclusive content such as behind the scene footage or wallpaper/music. The aim was to monetise adverts via Gamification, which allows NBC Universal to provide useful and enjoyable ads, which consumers would enjoy. </p>

                            <p>The application idea can also be extended to other products and services, which NBC Universal provides, such as theme parks in which consumers can undergo challenges to unlock movie cut scenes to enhance experience. For instance, a person walking around a universal theme park is asked to participate in a Minions challenge as they are near the Minion Mayhem ride in Universal Rolando Florida. The person can complete challenges with their family, unlocking content as they reach checkpoint, which they can share with friends and family via social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Dailymotion. In addition, the application can be adopted to advertise products by third parties such as Monopoly by Hasbro, as there is a Monopoly movie created by Universal Studios. </p>

                            <p>Using my previous knowledge of design, development and marketing I started by branding the application before creating the UX, app and promo video.  Due to the fact we only had 24 hours before the pitch I decided to create a promo video, which utilises one of their famous franchises: The Fast and Furious series.</p>

                            <p>A promotional video was created in which a user is nearby Letty’s London drag race scene, which is Piccadilly Circus.  The consumer gets a notification from Letty asking for a race, which the consumer accepts on his wearable and proceeds with his phone.  The challenge is a race from Piccadilly Circus to Leicester Square.</p>

                            <p>Once the consumer opens the app on his phone, he is then presented with more information about the challenge and a snippet of the London drag race scene. The user chooses to invite a friend, who gets a notification about the challenge, which is worded, with terminology from the movie, in this “Ride or Die”.</p>

                            <p>The friend accepts the challenge and the challenge begins, each consumer races from Piccadilly Circus to Leicester Square, the application shows location of themselves as well as their competing friend. In addition, Letty is also shown on the map to enhance the experience.</p>

                            <p>Once the consumer has reached the endpoint first, they are presented with a reward, which is a free cinema ticket to watch Furious 6.  Although a cinema ticket was given in this scenario, additional products and services such as behind the scenes clips and wallpapers can be given as rewards as larger profits and revenues can be gained. However, occasionally rewarding users with a cinema ticket can help the application become popular amongst users. </p>

                            <p>The app promo ends with the consumer sharing their experience via Facebook, which increases exposure for the movie and entices other friends and family to do the challenge.</p>

                            <p>The application business model can be utilised throughout all stages of a Universal release. For instance when a movie is about to be released, the challenge could create a buzz and awareness of the movie, thus rewarding consumers with wallpaper or music download. Once the release has been available on DVD or digital download, the challenge could highlight the nearest shop which stocks the DVD increasing impulse purchases for NBC Universal. Finally, when it has been over a year since the movie has been released, the application can be used to allow users to experience the movie again via the application, making them want to buy the movie via nearby shops.

                           <p>Go Urdu is a platform that teaches users key fundamentals of the Urdu language to start, escalate and end a conversation in Urdu. The iOS application acts as a learning tool, teaching users key topics to provide the background knowledge to speak and understand Urdu. The WatchOS application on the other hand acts as a tool to start, escalate and end a conversation by providing common and most used Urdu phrases available at the flick of the wrist. 
</p>



                        <p>Firstly, the development of the Go Urdu WatchOS application started. The first version of the Go Urdu Apple Watch app involved analysing popular smart watch apps to understand the journey and user experience provided by them. Once the analysis was complete, research into WatchOS 2 capabilities was gathered to determine whether the proposed Go Urdu Apple Watch app was possible.

                        <p></p>

                        <p>After gaining feedback, development of the Go Urdu Apple Watch app began in XCode. Initially, the Go Urdu Apple Watch app was mocked up using Interface Builder within XCode. The purpose of this was to have a prototype running natively on the Apple Watch to understand the user experience provided from the current design. Nevertheless, not all features were incorporated such as the ability to play Urdu translations natively on the Apple watch. 
</p>




                        <p>The second version of the Go Urdu Apple Watch app that was mocked up using the Interface Builder had a few UI changes, to ensure the Go Urdu Apple Watch application provided a good user experience, as well as follow Apple’s Human Guidelines for the Apple Watch.

<p></p>


                        <p>Improvements on the second version of the Go Urdu Apple Watch app included colour coded topics, to aid users by showcasing possible Urdu conversation topics based on priority. The Go Urdu Apple Watch app was then tested in several different cities within Pakistan to start, escalate and end a conversation in Urdu. The purpose of this was to put myself into the shoes of a person who has very limited knowledge of the Urdu language, however wants to start, escalate and end a conversation in Urdu without breaking the natural flow of the conversation.

                            <p></p>


                            <p>The overall feedback was positive, however due to key features not being implemented, people were unable to fully understand how the Go Urdu Apple Watch app functioned. During my visit to Pakistan, I created reenactments off the conversations with the Go Urdu Apple Watch app. The reenactments was then added with the missing features to show people how the Go Urdu Apple Watch app would function once completed.

                            <p></p>

                            <p>Once editing of the reenactments was completed, further development of the Go Urdu Apple Watch app was performed to see if the proposed Go Urdu Apple Watch app was still possible.
</p>

<p>When trying to add the ability to play Urdu translations on the Apple Watch natively, several problems were encountered. The first problem was the ability to press a button and play a sound. which was only achieved using the WKAudioFilePlayer class. However, the WKAudioFilePlayer class only allowed the ability to play sound via a connected Bluetooth speaker and not via the native speakers on the Apple Watch. Using the WKAudioFilePlayer class would render the Go Urdu Apple Watch app useless and provide a negative user experience.
</p>

<p>After determining the problems with playing Urdu translations natively on the Apple Watch, the feature was removed and then marketed as a tool which acted as a reference within Urdu conversations. Nevertheless, The Go Urdu Apple Watch was then tested with possible users and people who natively speak Urdu to get feedback from both types of people.
</p>

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/y5mRuRmuAaA' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p></p>

<p>Overall the feedback was good, but users still wanted the ability to play Urdu translations natively on the Apple Watch, to allow users to quickly understand the pronunciation of common and most used Urdu phrases. 
</p>

<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytDhn9g0p74' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p></p>

<p>After going through the WatchOS2 features documentation, the only other way to play Urdu translations natively on the Apple Watch app was, via invoking the WKInterfaceMovie class. The purpose of this feature was to play videos on the Apple Watch, whilst still using the native Apple Watch speaker. 
</p>

<p>Testing of the WKInterfaceMovie class was conducted. After the testing was proven successful, the Urdu translations were then created within Adobe Premiere Pro to match the resolutions and size ratio if the Apple Watch app. Therefore, when the user pressed on an Urdu translation within the application, a video is played which includes a picture of the Urdu translation and the Urdu translations playing natively on the Apple Watch app. 
</p>

<p>Although the ability to play Urdu translations natively on the Apple Watch involved a few extra screen taps and swipes via the WKInterfaceMovie class, the usefulness of the Go Urdu Apple Watch outweighed a much faster and less interactive Go Urdu Apple Watch which did not include the ability to play Urdu translations on the wrist.
</p>

<p>After the user experience and design was finalised, the remaining Urdu phrases was added. In addition, some UI changes was added, such as having pictures as buttons for each topic. The purpose of having pictures as buttons was to allow users to naturally understand what button associated with which topic without having to look at the the actual topic listed on the button. For instance, the English Greetings button has a picture of a person shaking another person’s hand. The picture informs the users that the button will provide phrases, allowing them to start a conversation with a person.

<p></p>

<p>The final version of the Go Urdu Apple Watch app improves over the previous version, by incorporating a video when playing the Urdu translation natively on the Apple Watch. The purpose of the video playing alongside the Urdu translation, is to to inform the user on how to perform the common phrase. Due to the little screen estate, background information about the common phrase was not incorporated, unlike the iOS app. Therefore, the video was required to provide similar information using suitable information architecture. 
</p>

<p>The final Go Urdu iOS app has had a few user interface changes to ensure familiarity between top current apps and allow for growth of the Go Urdu platform. Changes includes the use of a hamburger menu, to allow for instant access to different lessons. In addition, the ability to share lessons between iOS & non-iOS devices, which would lead to more users of the Go Urdu platform.

<p>Go Urdu for iOS & Apple Watch is now available on the App Store. During the reviewing period, additional contents such as 15s trailers for Facebook, Instagram and YouTube were employed to generate a ‘buzz’ around the Go Urdu application. </p>

<p>Go Urdu for iOS & Apple Watch is now available on the App Store. During the reviewing period, additional contents such as 15s trailers for Facebook, Instagram and YouTube were employed to generate a ‘buzz’ around the application. 

The Go Urdu application was also submitted for the Samsung Developer App Ideation Challenge, adopting technologies such as the Samsung Gear S2, Samsung S7 Edge smartphone and the Samsung Gear VR.

<p>The tvOS app was designed around being accessible using the Apple TV remote and was inspired from the YouTube iPad app. Where you can watch the content, whilst navigate the other options. This way the user can scroll through the content and choose something of interest to them.
</p>

<p>The tvOS app only presents the 3 minute lessons which are present in the iOS app, to provide an enjoyable living room experience which isn’t replicated by shuffling through several 2 second Quick Actions.

                            <p>In October 2015, I was invited to take part of the League of Labels Hackathon in Belgium. The purpose of the League of Labels Hackathon is to create an application which would help distributors and VOD platforms to provide content much easier, in addition improve parental control to protect the online activity of minors. The aim was to use Miracle’s API such as BBFC, PEGI and JusProg to help implement the stated criteria. The application which I created within 48 hours was called Smile. 


</p>






                            <p>Smile is an age and content determination platform which prevents children from bypassing traditional age restriction measures. Furthermore, the Smile platform redirects underage users to more suitable positive content. 
</p>

	<img src="img/portfolio/sm1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <p>The Smile platform determines age of the user using Project Oxford integration (Face Identification and Speech Intent Recognition). The determined age is compared to the age ratings of different types of contents such as film, apps, game and web using Miracle’s datasets and API’s such as BBFC, PEGI and JusProg. 
</p>

                            <p>The application was demonstrated on iOS at the end of the 48-hour Hackathon in a three-minute pitch. The application won the 1st prize which included € 3000.
</p>




                            <p>To learn more about Smile, the slides to pitch and transcript are shown below:

                            <p>“We live in a world where the internet plays a vital part of society. Performing tasks like checking email, online banking, viewing on demand content and getting turn by turn directions would not be possible without the internet.
</p>

                            <p>Although the Internet can enhance our lives, it can also allow children to access age restricted content much easier then before. Today age restrictions seem to more passive not active, allowing children to bypass age restriction measures by entering an older date of birth and giving false details. 
</p>

                            <p>For instance, in order to watch an age restricted video on YouTube, a Google Account must be created. A child can easily create an account within 5 minutes and will be given access to the mature content. In addition, this prevents adults from watching more mature content such as horror movies or comedies due to the inconvenience of creating a Google Account. This in turn causes less people to view the mature content, causing reduction in profit and income for the content creators and publishers.
</p>

                            <p>This is where Smile comes in.
</p>

							<p>Smile is an age and content determination platform which prevents children from bypassing traditional age restriction measures. In addition, the smile platform redirects underage users to more suitable positive content.
</p>

							<p>The smile platform determines age using Project Oxford’s (Face Identification & Speech Intent Recognition) to determine what age the user is. The determined age is compared to the age rating of different type of contents such as films, apps, game and web using Miracle’s datasets and API’s such as BBFC, PEGI, JusProg and more. 
</p>

                            <p>So as an example I will show you what happens when I try to choose a 15 rated movie from Netflix. As you can see I try to choose the comedy East is East which is rated 15, once the movie is chosen the Smile platform launches. The first step is to take a picture and say a phrase for facial and voice recognition. The phrase on top changes every time the Smile platform is launched, preventing children from bypassing the age restriction measure. Once the picture is taken Project Oxford is utilised for facial recognition which will determine age and Speech Intent Recognition which determine age of child via voice, as they may be occasions where a person may be older but looks younger and vice versa. 

</p>

 							<p>Once the process has finished, the rating of the content is shown and tick sign is shown if I am old enough to watch the movie. Once I press the tick sign, I am able to watch the movie.</p>

							<p>However, If I am not old enough to view the content, a cross sign is shown on screen. The user is not given access to restricted content, but alternative option is shown on screen. 
</p>


							<p>And that is how Smile works.</p>

							<p>The business opportunities for Smile could be providing the age and content determination platform as a paid service to Video On Demand platforms such as Netflix and YouTube to allow age of user to be determined quicker.</p>

							<p>For instance, watching an age rated video on YouTube requires creation of Google Account to verify age. Creating Google Account to verify age. Creating a Google Account takes 5 minutes whereas Smile can determine age within 20 seconds.</p>

							<p>In addition, Smile can be used by mobile network providers such as Vodafone which have similar services to ensure all mobile phones come with the feature by default. This prevents parents from needing to opt-in, at the same time adults can easily opt out using a one off verification process instead of phoning up Vodafone to remove the Smile filter. As you can see Smile can be used B2B (Business to Business) also B2C (Business 2 Customer).”</p>

                            <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Can You Save Your Takeaway?</p>
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/samosa.jpg" alt="">
                            <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/portfolio/takepromo.png" alt="">

                             <p>The Takeaway is an iOS exclusive game available on the App Store, which utilises iAds and Social Sharing capabilities. The aim of the game is to play with one hand swiping the bag left to right catching food from the Takeaway, whilst avoid the fruit. The iOS game is targeted at the casual gamer due to the low learning curve and “replayability”.
</p>

                            <p>The game increases in difficulty as the user gains more food in the bag. Once the user has finished the game, their score can be shared via Email, WhatsApp, Twitter and many more social platforms. The use of sharing the score via social platforms, will allow the game to be more marketable as the game would act as a common interest between friends and family.
</p>

                            <p>The Takeaway is available on the App Store; however, marketing material was adopted to create a buzz for the game prior to release. The marketing material includes 15 second adverts shared on YouTube, Twitter and Instagram with magic tricks to increase visibility of the product due to the wow factor. In addition, tailored hashtags such as #thetakeaway was created to group promotional material of the game, as well as scores posted by users. 
</p>

							<p>The Takeaway does incorporate iAds which only appear on the main screen instead of the game screen or end screen. The goal was to allow the user to be immersed in the experience without being bombarded with multiple iAds, this would have led to reduced downloads and less people playing the game.
